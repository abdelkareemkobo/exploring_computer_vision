# Exploring Computer Vision 

Welcome to my personal repository for studying computer vision! Here, I will be focusing on general models like Detectron2, YOLOv8, DINOv2, and more. I will be reading their related papers and exploring existing projects.

# Technologies 

The main technologies I will be using are PyTorch, Lightning, fastai, fastapi, TensorFlow, and Jax.

# Languages 

I will be using Python, C++, and Rust for my computer vision projects.

# Features 

My farm of vision models includes:

- Detectron2
- YOLOv8
- DINOv2
- And more!

# Setup 

To use this repository, you may need to install some libraries and frameworks depending on the project you are interested in.

# Illustrations 

I will include illustrations and visualizations of the computer vision models and datasets I am working with.

# Scope of functionalities 

My goal is to learn and master the functionalities of the computer vision models I am exploring, including object detection, instance segmentation, and image classification.

# Example of use 

I will provide code examples and demonstrations of how to use these models to solve real-world computer vision problems.

# Project status 

This is an ongoing project, and I will be updating the repository as I learn and progress.

# Sources 

I will be reading and summarizing papers related to the computer vision models I am exploring, as well as consulting the official documentation and community forums.
